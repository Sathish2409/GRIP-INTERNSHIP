# GRIP-INTERNSHIPS
        The Graduate Rotational Internship Program from the Sparks Foundations consists of four tasks.
**TASK-1:LINKEDIN PROFILE CREATION;**<br/>
In the first task, an linkedin profile is to created and maintained properly.<br/>
**TASK-2:TO EXPLORE SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING;**<br/>
In the second task, a regression based machine learning model is used to predict the percentage of marks scored by a student based on the number of hours, that a student have studied.<br/>
**TASK-3:TO EXPLORE UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING;**<br/>
In the third task, KMeans clustering based unsupervised machine learning model is used to predict the optimum number of clusters for a given Iris dataset and is visualized graphically.<br/>
**TASK-4:TO EXPLORE DECISION TREE ALGORITHM;**<br/>
In the fourth task, Decision tree classifier model is used to predict the right classes for species column in a given Iris dataset.<br/>
